Made cover pages for both Briston and Boss clearer. Edited a few other images and integrated the following changes :

For both the BOSS and Briston proposals – the headers, footers and images on the cover page look a bit blurry.  Is there a way we can fix that? – They are still blurry.

For both the BOSS and Briston proposals – how come the margins are different in the Word document compared to the PDF?  I like the margins (left and right indents) on the published PDF. – The Word document has issues.  The header and footer are not aligned, they are off the page.  Please see attached “Word proposal example - Updated test”.  This is for both Briston and BOSS.

For the Briston proposal – when published in Word, the name of the client is on the next page instead of on the cover page. – this hasn’t been fixed.
